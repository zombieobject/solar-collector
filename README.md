# Sol-9000: Solar Collector Simulator

This project aims to simulate the heat transfer from a solar panel to a storage tank. 

Sample values for temparature and solar radiation were collected from the NOAA website in the San Fransico Bay area.

The user interface plots a graph that measures water temperature in 2 locations; one at the solar collector and another at the bottom of the storage tank where water exits the tank on its way back to the solar collector. Touch is enabled on the graph which will display the temperature readings at the point of interaction.

In addition to the graph, there is a slider at the bottom of the user interface which will simulate different radiation factors based on cloud cover. When changing the radiation factor, the graph will automatically update.
